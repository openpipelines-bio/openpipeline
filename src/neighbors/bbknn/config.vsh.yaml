    type: string
    default: "rna"
    required: false

    type: string
    description: .obs column name discriminating between your batches.
    default: "batch"

  # outputs
  - name: "--output"
    alternatives: ["-o"]
    type: file
    description: Output .h5mu file.
    direction: output
    required: true
    example: output.h5mu
  
  - name: "--output_compression"
    type: string
    description: The compression format to be used on the output h5mu object.
    choices: ["gzip", "lzf"]
    required: false
    example: "gzip"
    
  - name: "--uns_output"
    type: string
    default: neighbors
    description: Mandatory .uns slot to store various neighbor output objects.
    
  - name: "--obsp_distances"
    type: string
    default: "distances"
    description: "In which .obsp slot to store the distance matrix between the resulting neighbors."
    
  - name: "--obsp_connectivities"
    type: string
    default: "connectivities"
    description: "In which .obsp slot to store the connectivities matrix between the resulting neighbors."

  # arguments
  - name: "--n_neighbors_within_batch"
    type: integer
    description: How many top neighbours to report for each batch; total number of neighbours in the initial k-nearest-neighbours computation will be this number times the number of batches.
    default: 3
  - name: "--n_pcs"
    type: integer
    description: How many dimensions (in case of PCA, principal components) to use in the analysis.
    default: 50
  - name: "--n_trim"
    type: integer
    description: Trim the neighbours of each cell to these many top connectivities. May help with population independence and improve the tidiness of clustering. The lower the value the more independent the individual populations, at the cost of more conserved batch effect. If `None` (default), sets the parameter value automatically to 10 times `neighbors_within_batch` times the number of batches. Set to 0 to skip.
