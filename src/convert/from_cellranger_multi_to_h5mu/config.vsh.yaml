name: "from_cellranger_multi_to_h5mu"
namespace: "convert"
description: |
  Converts the output from cellranger multi to a single .h5mu file.
  By default, will map the following library type names to modality names:
    - Gene Expression: rna
    - Peaks: atac
    - Antibody Capture: prot
    - VDJ: vdj
    - VDJ-T: vdj_t
    - VDJ-B: vdj_b
    - CRISPR Guide Capture: crispr
    - Multiplexing Capture: hashing
    
  Other library types have their whitepace removed and dashes replaced by
  underscores to generate the modality name.

  Currently does not allow parsing the output from cell barcode demultiplexing.
