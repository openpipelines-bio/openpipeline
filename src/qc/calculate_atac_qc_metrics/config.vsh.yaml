description: |
  Add basic ATAC quality control metrics to an .h5mu file.

  The metrics are comparable to what scanpy.pp.calculate_qc_metrics output,
  although they have slightly different names:

  Obs metrics (name in this component -> name in scanpy):
    - n_features_per_cell -> n_genes_by_counts
    - total_fragment_counts -> total_counts
