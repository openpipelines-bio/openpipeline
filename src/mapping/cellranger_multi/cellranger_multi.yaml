          - included: A TRUE or FALSE flag specifying whether the probe is included in the filtered counts matrix output or excluded by the probe filter. 
                      See filter-probes option of cellranger multi. All probes of a gene must be marked TRUE in the included column for that gene to be included.
          - region: Present only in v1.0.1 probe set reference CSV. The gene boundary targeted by the probe. Accepted values are spliced or unspliced.

          The file also contains a number of required metadata fields in the header in the format #key=value:
          - panel_name: The name of the probe set.
          - panel_type: Always predesigned for predesigned probe sets.
          - reference_genome: The reference genome build used for probe design.
          - reference_version: The version of the Cell Ranger reference transcriptome used for probe design.
          - probe_set_file_format: The version of the probe set file format specification that this file conforms to.
      - type: boolean  # Null is also a valid option because passing this argument to cellranger (true or false) requires --probe_set 
        name: "--filter_probes"
        description: |
          If 'false', include all non-deprecated probes listed in the probe set reference CSV file.
          If 'true' or not set, probes that are predicted to have off-target activity to homologous genes are excluded from analysis.
          Not filtering will result in UMI counts from all non-deprecated probes,
          including those with predicted off-target activity, to be used in the analysis.
          Probes whose ID is prefixed with DEPRECATED are always excluded from the analysis.

      - type: string
        name: "--probe_barcode_ids"
        multiple: true
        description: |
          The Fixed RNA Probe Barcode ID used for this sample, and for multiplex GEX + Antibody Capture libraries,
          the corresponding Antibody Multiplexing Barcode IDs. 10x recommends specifying both barcodes (e.g., BC001+AB001)
          when an Antibody Capture library is present. The barcode pair order is BC+AB and they
          are separated with a "+" (no spaces). Alternatively, you can specify the Probe Barcode ID alone and
          Cell Ranger's barcode pairing auto-detection algorithm will automatically match to the corresponding Antibody
          Multiplexing Barcode.
      - type: integer
        name: --emptydrops_minimum_umis
        min: 1
        description: |
          For singleplex Flex experiments, use this option to adjust the UMI cutoff during the second step of cell calling.
          Cell Ranger will still perform the full cell calling process but will only evaluate barcodes with UMIs above
          the threshold you specify.

  - name: Antigen Capture (BEAM) libary arguments
    # These end up in the [antigen-specificity] section
    description: |
      These arguments are recommended if an Antigen Capture (BEAM) library is present. 
      It is needed to calculate the antigen specificity score.
    arguments:
      - type: string
        name: --control_id
        multiple: true
        description: |
          A user-defined ID for any negative controls used in the T/BCR Antigen Capture assay. Must match id specified in the feature reference CSV.
          May only include ASCII characters and must not use whitespace, slash, quote, or comma characters. 
          Each ID must be unique and must not collide with a gene identifier from the transcriptome.
      - type: string
        multiple: true
        name: --mhc_allele
        description: |
          The MHC allele for TCR Antigen Capture libraries. Must match mhc_allele name specified in the Feature Reference CSV.
  - name: "General arguments"
    description: |
      These arguments are applicable to all library types.
    arguments:
      - name: "--check_library_compatibility"
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: |
          Optional. This option allows users to disable the check that evaluates 10x Barcode overlap between
          ibraries when multiple libraries are specified (e.g., Gene Expression + Antibody Capture). Setting
          this option to false will disable the check across all library combinations. We recommend running
          this check (default), however if the pipeline errors out, users can bypass the check to generate
          outputs for troubleshooting.
