          - probe_id: The probe identifier, whose format is described in Probe identifiers.
          - included: A TRUE or FALSE flag specifying whether the probe is included in the filtered counts matrix output or excluded by the probe filter. 
                      See filter-probes option of cellranger multi. All probes of a gene must be marked TRUE in the included column for that gene to be included.
          - region: Present only in v1.0.1 probe set reference CSV. The gene boundary targeted by the probe. Accepted values are spliced or unspliced.

        description: |
          A user-defined ID for any negative controls used in the T/BCR Antigen Capture assay. Must match id specified in the feature reference CSV.
          May only include ASCII characters and must not use whitespace, slash, quote, or comma characters. 
          Each ID must be unique and must not collide with a gene identifier from the transcriptome.
      - type: string
        multiple: true
        name: --mhc_allele
        description: |
          The MHC allele for TCR Antigen Capture libraries. Must match mhc_allele name specified in the Feature Reference CSV.
  - name: "General arguments"

      These arguments are applicable to all library types.
    arguments:
      - name: "--check_library_compatibility"
        type: boolean
        default: true
        description: |
          Optional. This option allows users to disable the check that evaluates 10x Barcode overlap between
          ibraries when multiple libraries are specified (e.g., Gene Expression + Antibody Capture). Setting
          this option to false will disable the check across all library combinations. We recommend running
          this check (default), however if the pipeline errors out, users can bypass the check to generate
          outputs for troubleshooting.
