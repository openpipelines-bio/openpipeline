          - included: A TRUE or FALSE flag specifying whether the probe is included in the filtered counts matrix output or excluded by the probe filter. 
                      See filter-probes option of cellranger multi. All probes of a gene must be marked TRUE in the included column for that gene to be included.
          - region: Present only in v1.0.1 probe set reference CSV. The gene boundary targeted by the probe. Accepted values are spliced or unspliced.
