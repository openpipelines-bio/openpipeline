  Eliminating technical artifacts from high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing data.

  This module removes counts due to ambient RNA molecules and random barcode swapping from (raw) UMI-based scRNA-seq count matrices. 
  At the moment, only the count matrices produced by the CellRanger count pipeline is supported. Support for additional tools and protocols 
  will be added in the future. A quick start tutorial can be found here.

      - name: "--total_droplets_included"
        type: integer
        description: |
          The number of droplets from the rank-ordered UMI plot
          that will be analyzed. The largest 'total_droplets'
          droplets will have their cell probabilities inferred
          as an output.

      - name: "--model"
        type: string
        choices: [simple, ambient, swapping, full]
        description: |
          Which model is being used for count data. 'simple'
          does not model either ambient RNA or random barcode
          swapping (for debugging purposes -- not recommended).
          'ambient' assumes background RNA is incorporated into
          droplets. 'swapping' assumes background RNA comes from
          random barcode swapping. 'full' uses a combined
          ambient and swapping model.
        default: full

      - name: "--low_count_threshold"
        type: integer
        description: |
          Droplets with UMI counts below this number are completely 
          excluded from the analysis. This can help identify the correct 
          prior for empty droplet counts in the rare case where empty 
          counts are extremely high (over 200).

      - name: "--empty_drop_training_fraction"
        type: double
        description: |
          Training detail: the fraction of the training data each epoch that 
          is drawn (randomly sampled) from surely empty droplets.
        default: 0.5
      - name: "--fpr"
        type: double
        description: |
          Target false positive rate in (0, 1). A false positive
          is a true signal count that is erroneously removed.
          More background removal is accompanied by more signal
          removal at high values of FPR. You can specify
          multiple values, which will create multiple output
          files.
        multiple: true
        default: [0.01]
      - name: "--exclude_antibody_capture"
        type: boolean_true
        description: |
          Including the flag --exclude-antibody-capture will
          cause remove-background to operate on gene counts
          only, ignoring other features.
      - name: "--learning_rate"
        type: double
        description: |
          Training detail: lower learning rate for inference. A
          OneCycle learning rate schedule is used, where the
          upper learning rate is ten times this value. (For this
          value, probably do not exceed 1e-3).
        example: 0.0001
      - name: "--cuda"
        type: boolean_true
        description: |
          Including the flag --cuda will run the inference on a
          GPU.
