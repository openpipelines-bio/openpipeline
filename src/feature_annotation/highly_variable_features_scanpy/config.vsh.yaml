  Annotate highly variable features [Satija15] [Zheng17] [Stuart19].

  Expects logarithmized data, except when flavor='seurat_v3' in which count data is expected.

  Depending on flavor, this reproduces the R-implementations of Seurat [Satija15], Cell Ranger [Zheng17], and Seurat v3 [Stuart19].

  For the dispersion-based methods ([Satija15] and [Zheng17]), the normalized dispersion is obtained by scaling with the mean and standard deviation of the dispersions for features falling into a given bin for mean expression of features. This means that for each bin of mean expression, highly variable features are selected.

  For [Stuart19], a normalized variance for each feature is computed. First, the data are standardized (i.e., z-score normalization per feature) with a regularized standard deviation. Next, the normalized variance is computed as the variance of each feature after the transformation. Features are ranked by the normalized variance.

      Choose the flavor for identifying highly variable features. For the dispersion based methods
      in their default workflows, Seurat passes the cutoffs whereas Cell Ranger passes n_top_features.

  - name: "--n_bins"
    type: integer
    description: Number of bins for binning the mean feature expression. Normalization is done with respect to each bin. If just a single feature falls into a bin, the normalized dispersion is artificially set to 1.
    default: 20
  
  - name: "--obs_batch_key"
    type: string
    description: |
      If specified, highly-variable features are selected within each batch separately and merged. This simple 
      process avoids the selection of batch-specific features and acts as a lightweight batch correction method. 
      For all flavors, features are first sorted by how many batches they are a HVG. For dispersion-based flavors 
      ties are broken by normalized dispersion. If flavor = 'seurat_v3', ties are broken by the median (across
      batches) rank based on within-batch normalized variance.
