  description: |
    This workflow serves as an entrypoint into the 'full_pipeline' in order to
    re-run the multisample processing and the integration setup. An input .h5mu file will 
    first be split in order to run the multisample processing per modality. Next, the modalities
    are merged again and the integration setup pipeline is executed. Please note that this workflow
    assumes that samples from multiple pipelines are already concatenated.

          type: string

            If specified, highly-variable genes are selected within each batch separately and merged. This simple 
            process avoids the selection of batch-specific genes and acts as a lightweight batch correction method.
    - name: "QC metrics calculation options"
      arguments:
        - name: "--var_qc_metrics"
          description: |
            Keys to select a boolean (containing only True or False) column from .var.
            For each cell, calculate the proportion of total values for genes which are labeled 'True', 
            compared to the total sum of the values for all genes.

          description: |
            Number of top vars to be used to calculate cumulative proportions.
            If not specified, proportions are not calculated. `--top_n_vars 20,50` finds
            cumulative proportion to the 20th and 50th most expressed vars.
