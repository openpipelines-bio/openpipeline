            If specified, highly-variable genes are selected within each batch separately and merged. This simple 
            process avoids the selection of batch-specific genes and acts as a lightweight batch correction method. 
            For all flavors, genes are first sorted by how many batches they are a HVG. For dispersion-based flavors 
            ties are broken by normalized dispersion. If flavor = 'seurat_v3', ties are broken by the median (across
            batches) rank based on within-batch normalized variance.

          description: |
            Choose the flavor for identifying highly variable genes. For the dispersion based methods
            in their default workflows, Seurat passes the cutoffs whereas Cell Ranger passes n_top_genes.
