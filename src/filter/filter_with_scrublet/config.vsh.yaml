  Doublet detection using the Scrublet method (Wolock, Lopez and Klein, 2019).
  The method tests for potential doublets by using the expression profiles of
  cells to generate synthetic potential doubles which are tested against cells. 
  The method returns a "doublet score" on which it calls for potential doublets.
  
  For the source code please visit https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/scrublet.
  
  For 10x we expect the doublet rates to be:
    Multiplet Rate (%) - # of Cells Loaded - # of Cells Recovered
    ~0.4% ~800 ~500
    ~0.8% ~1,600 ~1,000
    ~1.6% ~3,200 ~2,000
    ~2.3% ~4,800 ~3,000
    ~3.1% ~6,400 ~4,000
    ~3.9% ~8,000 ~5,000
    ~4.6% ~9,600 ~6,000
    ~5.4% ~11,200 ~7,000
    ~6.1% ~12,800 ~8,000
    ~6.9% ~14,400 ~9,000
    ~7.6% ~16,000 ~10,000
