    - name: Arguments UMMAP
      arguments:
        - name: "--min_dist"
          type: double
          description: The effective minimum distance between embedded points. Smaller values will result in a more clustered/clumped embedding where nearby points on the manifold are drawn closer together, while larger values will result on a more even dispersal of points. The value should be set relative to the spread value, which determines the scale at which embedded points will be spread out. 
          default: 0.5

        - name: "--spread"
          type: double
          description: The effective scale of embedded points. In combination with `min_dist` this determines how clustered/clumped the embedded points are.
          default: 1.0

        - name: "--num_components"
          type: integer
          description: The number of dimensions of the embedding.
          default: 2

        - name: "--max_iter"
          type: integer
          description: The number of iterations (epochs) of the optimization. Called `n_epochs` in the original UMAP. Default is set to 500 if neighbors['connectivities'].shape[0] <= 10000, else 200.

        - name: "--alpha"
          type: double
          description: The initial learning rate for the embedding optimization.
          default: 1.0

        - name: "--gamma"
          type: double
          description: Weighting applied to negative samples in low dimensional embedding optimization. Values higher than one will result in greater weight being given to negative samples.
          default: 1.0

        - name: "--negative_sample_rate"
          type: integer
          description: The number of negative edge/1-simplex samples to use per positive edge/1-simplex sample in optimizing the low dimensional embedding.
          default: 5
          
        - name: "--init_pos"
          type: string
          description: |
            How to initialize the low dimensional embedding. Called `init` in the original UMAP. Options are:
            
            * Any key from `.obsm`
            * `'paga'`: positions from `paga()`
            * `'spectral'`: use a spectral embedding of the graph
            * `'random'`: assign initial embedding positions at random.

          default: spectral

    - name: Arguments densMAP
      arguments:
        - name: "--lambda"
          type: double
          description: Controls the regularization weight of the density correlation term in densMAP. Higher values prioritize density preservation over the UMAP objective, and vice versa for values closer to zero. Setting this parameter to zero is equivalent to running the original UMAP algorithm.
          default: 2.0

        - name: "--fraction"
          type: double
          description: Controls the fraction of epochs (between 0 and 1) where the density-augmented objective is used in densMAP. The first (1 - dens_frac) fraction of epochs optimize the original UMAP objective before introducing the density correlation term.
          default: 0.3

        - name: "--var_shift"
          type: double
          description: A small constant added to the variance of local radii in the embedding when calculating the density correlation objective to prevent numerical instability from dividing by a small number
          default: 0.1
