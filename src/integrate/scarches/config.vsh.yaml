          Key in adata.obs for size factor information. Instead of using library size as a size factor,
          the provided size factor column will be used as offset in the mean of the likelihood.

        description: |
          Keys in adata.obs that correspond to categorical data. These covariates can be added in
          addition to the batch covariate and are also treated as nuisance factors
          (i.e., the model tries to minimize their effects on the latent space).
          Thus, these should not be used for biologically-relevant factors that you do _not_ want to correct for.
          Important: the order of the categorical covariates matters and should match the order of the covariates in the trained reference model.

          (i.e., the model tries to minimize their effects on the latent space). Thus, these should not be
          used for biologically-relevant factors that you do _not_ want to correct for.
