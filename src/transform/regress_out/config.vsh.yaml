  name: regress_out
  namespace: "transform"
  version: "dev"
  description: |
    Regress out (mostly) unwanted sources of variation.
    Uses simple linear regression. This is inspired by Seurat's regressOut function in R [Satija15]. 
    Note that this function tends to overcorrect in certain circumstances as described in issue theislab/scanpy#526.
    See https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/issues/526.
