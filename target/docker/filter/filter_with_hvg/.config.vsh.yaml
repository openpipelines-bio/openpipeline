    \ for genes falling into a given bin for mean expression of genes. This means\
    \ that for each bin of mean expression, highly variable genes are selected.\n\n\
    For [Stuart19], a normalized variance for each gene is computed. First, the data\
    \ are standardized (i.e., z-score normalization per feature) with a regularized\
    \ standard deviation. Next, the normalized variance is computed as the variance\
    \ of each gene after the transformation. Genes are ranked by the normalized variance.\n"
