description: "Annotate highly variable features [Satija15] [Zheng17] [Stuart19].\n\
  \nExpects logarithmized data, except when flavor='seurat_v3' in which count data\
  \ is expected.\n\nDepending on flavor, this reproduces the R-implementations of\
  \ Seurat [Satija15], Cell Ranger [Zheng17], and Seurat v3 [Stuart19].\n\nFor the\
  \ dispersion-based methods ([Satija15] and [Zheng17]), the normalized dispersion\
  \ is obtained by scaling with the mean and standard deviation of the dispersions\
  \ for features falling into a given bin for mean expression of features. This means\
  \ that for each bin of mean expression, highly variable features are selected.\n\
  \nFor [Stuart19], a normalized variance for each feature is computed. First, the\
  \ data are standardized (i.e., z-score normalization per feature) with a regularized\
  \ standard deviation. Next, the normalized variance is computed as the variance\
  \ of each feature after the transformation. Features are ranked by the normalized\
  \ variance.\n"
