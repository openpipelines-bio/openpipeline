  summary: "Best-practice workflows for single-cell multi-omics analyses.\n"
  description: "OpenPipelines are extensible single cell analysis pipelines for reproducible\
    \ and large-scale single cell processing using [Viash](https://viash.io) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).\n\
    \nIn terms of workflows, the following has been made available, but keep in mind\
    \ that\nindividual tools and functionality can be executed as standalone components\
    \ as well.\n\n  * Demultiplexing: conversion of raw sequencing data to FASTQ objects.\n\
    \  * Ingestion: Read mapping and generating a count matrix.\n  * Single sample\
    \ processing: cell filtering and doublet detection.\n  * Multisample processing:\
    \ Count transformation, normalization, QC metric calulations.\n  * Integration:\
    \ Clustering, integration and batch correction using single and multimodal methods.\n\
    \  * Downstream analysis workflows\n"
