    \ the topology of the data, which we represent throughout Scanpy using a neighborhood\
    \ graph. tSNE, by contrast, optimizes the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances\
    \ in the embedding such that these best match the distribution of distances in\
    \ the high-dimensional space. We use the implementation of umap-learn [McInnes18].\
    \ For a few comparisons of UMAP with tSNE, see this preprint.\n"
