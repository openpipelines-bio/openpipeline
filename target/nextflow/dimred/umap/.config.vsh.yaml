description: "UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a manifold learning\
  \ technique suitable for visualizing high-dimensional data. Besides tending to be\
  \ faster than tSNE, it optimizes the embedding such that it best reflects the topology\
  \ of the data, which we represent throughout Scanpy using a neighborhood graph.\
  \ tSNE, by contrast, optimizes the distribution of nearest-neighbor distances in\
  \ the embedding such that these best match the distribution of distances in the\
  \ high-dimensional space. We use the implementation of umap-learn [McInnes18]. For\
  \ a few comparisons of UMAP with tSNE, see this preprint.\n"
