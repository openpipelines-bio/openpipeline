    \ Seurat [Satija15], Cell Ranger [Zheng17], and Seurat v3 [Stuart19].\n\nFor the\
    \ dispersion-based methods ([Satija15] and [Zheng17]), the normalized dispersion\
    \ is obtained by scaling with the mean and standard deviation of the dispersions\
    \ for features falling into a given bin for mean expression of features. This\
    \ means that for each bin of mean expression, highly variable features are selected.\n\
    \nFor [Stuart19], a normalized variance for each feature is computed. First, the\
    \ data are standardized (i.e., z-score normalization per feature) with a regularized\
    \ standard deviation. Next, the normalized variance is computed as the variance\
    \ of each feature after the transformation. Features are ranked by the normalized\
    \ variance.\n"
