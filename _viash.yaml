summary: |
  Best-practice workflows for single-cell multi-omics analyses.
  
description: |
  OpenPipelines are extensible single cell analysis pipelines for reproducible and large-scale single cell processing using [Viash](https://viash.io) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/).

  In terms of workflows, the following has been made available, but keep in mind that
  individual tools and functionality can be executed as standalone components as well.

    * Demultiplexing: conversion of raw sequencing data to FASTQ objects.
    * Ingestion: Read mapping and generating a count matrix.
    * Single sample processing: cell filtering and doublet detection.
    * Multisample processing: Count transformation, normalization, QC metric calulations.
    * Integration: Clustering, integration and batch correction using single and multimodal methods.
    * Downstream analysis workflows
