# openpipeline 0.3.1

## MINOR CHANGES

* Fix `interactive/run_cirrocumulus` script raising `NotImplementedError` caused by using `MutData.var_names_make_unique()` 
on each modality instead of on the whole `MuData` object.

* Fix `transform/normalize_total` and `interactive/run_cirrocumulus` component build missing a hdf5 dependency.

* `interactive/run_cellxgene`: Updated container to ubuntu:focal because it contains python3.6 but cellxgene dropped python3.6 support.

* `download/download_file`: Switch base container from `ubuntu:22.04` to `bash:5.1` because `ubuntu:22.04`
  was causing some edge case issues.

* `mapping/bd_rhapsody_wta`: Set `--parallel` to true by default.
