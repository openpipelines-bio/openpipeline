* The `transfer/publish` component is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release (PR #941).


# MINOR CHANGES

* Bump viash to `0.9.3` (PR #995).

* Several workflows: refactor neighbors, leiden and UMAP in a separate subworkflow (PR #942 and PR #949).

# openpipelines 2.0.0

## BREAKING CHANGES

* `velocity/scvelo`: update `scvelo` to `0.3.3`, which also removes support for using `loom` input files. The component now uses a `MuData` object as input. Several arguments were added to support selecting different inputs from the MuData file: `counts_layer`, `modality`, `layer_spliced`, `layer_unspliced`, `layer_ambiguous`. An `output_h5mu` argument was has been added (PR #932). 

* `src/annotate/onclass` and `src/annotate/celltypist`: Input parameter for gene name layers of input datasets has been updated to `--input_var_gene_names` and `reference_var_gene_names` (PR #919).

* Several components under `src/scgpt` (`cross_check_genes`, `tokenize_pad`, `binning`) now processes the input (query) datasets differently. Instead of subsetting datasets based on genes in the model vocabulary and/or highly variable genes, these components require an input .var column with a boolean mask specifying this information. The results are written back to the original input data, preserving the dataset structure (PR #832).

* `query/cellxgene_census`: The default output layer has been changed from `.layers["counts"]` to `.X` to be more aligned with the standard OpenPipelines format (PR #933).
  Use argument `--output_layer_counts counts` to revert the behaviour to the previous default.

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `filter/filter_with_scrublet`: provide cleaner error message when running scrublet on an empty modality (PR #929).

* Several component (cleanup): remove workaround for using being able to use shared utility functions with Nextflow Fusion (PR #920).

* `scgpt/cell_type_annotation` component update: Added support for multi-processing (PR #832).

* Several annotation (`src/annotate/`) components (`onclass`, `celltypist`, `random_forest_annotation`, `scanvi`, `svm_annotation`): Updated input parameteres to ensure uniformity across components, implemented functionality to cross-check the overlap of genes between query and reference (model) datasets and implemented logic to allow for subsetting of genes (PR #919). 

* `workflows/annotation/scgpt_annotation` workflow: Added a scGPT transformer-based cell type annotation workflow (PR #832).

* `scgpt/cross_check_genes` component update: Highly variable genes are now cross-checked based on the boolean mask in `var_input`. The filtering information is stored in the `--output_var_filter` .var field instead of subsetting the dataset (PR #832).

* `scgpt/binning` component update: This component now requires the `--var_input` parameter to provide gene filtering information. Binned data is written to the `--output_obsm_binned_counts` .obsm field in the original input data (PR #832).

* `scgpt/pad_tokenize` component update: Genes are padded and tokenized based on filtering information in `--var_input` and `--input_obsm_binned_counts` (PR #832).

* `resources_test_scripts/scgpt.sh`: Update scGPT test resources to avoid subsetting of datasets (PR #926).

* `workflows/integration/scgpt_leiden` workflow update: Update workflow such that input dataset is not subsetted for HVG but uses boolean masks in .var field instead (PR #875).

* `dataflow/split_h5mu`: Update memory label from `lowmem` to `highmem` and cpu label from `singlecpu` to `lowcpu` (PR #930).

# openpipelines 2.0.0-rc.2

## BUG FIXES

## MINOR CHANGES

* `dataflow/split_h5mu`: Optimize resource usage of the component (PR #913).

# openpipelines 2.0.0-rc.1

## BREAKING CHANGES

* Added cell multiplexing support to the `from_cellranger_multi_to_h5mu` component and the `cellranger_multi` workflow. For the `from_cellranger_multi_to_h5mu` component, the `output` argument now requires a value containing a wildcard character `*`, which will be replaced by the sample ID to form the final output file names. Additionally, a `sample_csv` argument is added to the `from_cellragner_multi_to_h5mu` component which describes the sample name per output file. No change is required for the `output_h5mu` argument from the `cellranger_multi` workflow, the workflow will just emit multiple events in case of a multiplexed run, one for each sample. The id of the events (and default output file names) are set by `--sample_ids` (in case of cell multiplexing), or (as before) by the user provided `id` for the input (PR #803 and PR #902).

* `lianapy`: bumped version to `1.3.0` (PR #827 and PR #862). Additionally, `groupby` is now a required argument.

* `concat`: this component was deprecated and has now been removed, use `concatenate_h5mu` instead (PR #796).

* The `workflows` folder in the root of the project no longer contains symbolic links to the build workflows in `target`.
  Using any workflows that was previously linked in this directory will now result in an error which will indicate
  the location of the workflow to be used instead (PR #796).
  
* `XGBoost`: bump version to `2.0.3` (PR #646).

* Several components: update anndata to `0.11.1` and mudata to `0.3.1` (PR #645 and PR #901), and scanpy to `1.10.4` (PR #901). 

* `filter/filter_with_hvg`: this component was deprecated and has now been removed. Use `feature_annotation/highly_variable_features_scanpy` instead (PR #843).

* `dataflow/concat`: this component was deprecated and has now been removed. Use `dataflow/concatenate_h5mu` instead (PR #857).

* `convert/from_h5mu_to_seurat`: bump seurat to latest version (PR #850).

* `reference/cellranger_mkgtf`: Rename `reference/mkgtf` to `reference/cellranger_mkgtf` (PR #846).

* `labels_transfer/xgboost`: Align interface with new annotation workflow
  - Store label probabilities instead of uncertainties
  - Take `.h5mu` format as an input instead of `.h5ad`

* `reference/build_cellranger_arc_reference`: a default value of "output" is now specified for the argument `--genome`, inline with `reference/build_cellranger_reference` component. Additionally, providing a value for `--organism` is no longer required and its default value of `Homo Sapiens` has been removed (PR #864).

* `qc/calculate_qc_metrics`: increase total counts accuracy with low precision floating dtypes as input layer (PR # , backported from PR #852).

# openpipelines 1.0.2

## BUG FIXES

* `dataflow/concatenate_h5mu`: fix writing out multidimensional annotation dataframes (e.g. `.varm`) that had their 
  data dtype (dtype) changed as a result of adding more observations after concatenation, causing `TypeError`.
  One notable example of this happening is when one of the samples does not have a multimodal annotation dataframe 
  which is present in another sample; causing the values being filled with `NA` (PR #842, backported from PR #837).

# openpipelines 1.0.1

## BUG FIXES

* Bump viash to `0.8.6` (PR #816, backported from #815). This changes the at-runtime generated nextflow process from an in-memory to an on-disk temporary file, which should cause less issues with Nextflow Fusion.

# openpipelines 1.0.0-rc6

## BUG FIXES

* `dataflow/concatenate_h5mu`: fix regression bug where observations are no longer linked to the correct metadata
after concatenation (PR #807)

# openpipelines 1.0.0-rc5

## BUG FIXES

* `cluster/leiden`: prevent leiden component from hanging when a child process is killed (e.g. when there is not enough memory available) (PR #805).

# openpipelines 1.0.0-rc4

## BREAKING CHANGES

* `query/cellxgene_census`: Refactored the interface, documentation and internal workings of this component (PR #621).
  - Renamed arguments to align with standard OpenPipelines notations and cellxgene census API:
    - `--input_database` became `--input_uri`
    - `--cellxgene_release` became `--census_version`
    - `--cell_query` became `--obs_value_filter`
    - `--cells_filter_columns` became `--cell_filter_grouping`
    - `--min_cells_filter_columns` became `--cell_filter_minimum_count`
    - `--modality` became `--output_modality`
    - Removed `--dataset_id` since it was no longer being used.
    - Added `--add_dataset_meta` to add metadata to the output MuData object.
  - Documentation of the component and its arguments was improved.

## BUG FIXES

* `mapping/cellranger_multi`: Fix the regex for the fastq input files to allow dropping the lane from the input file names (e.g. `_L001`) (PR #778).

* `workflows/rna/rna_singlesample`: Fix argument passing `top_n_vars` and `obs_name_mitochondrial_fraction` to the `qc` subworkflow (PR #779).

# openpipelines 1.0.0-rc3

## BREAKING CHANGES

* Docker image names now use `/` instead of `_` between the name of the component and the namespace (PR #712).

## BUG FIXES

* `rna_singlesample`: fixed a bug where selecting the column for the filtering with mitochondrial fractions 
  using `obs_name_mitochondrial_fraction` was done with the wrong column name, causing `ValueError` (PR #743).

* Fix publishing in `process_samples` and `process_batches` (PR #759).

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `dimred/tsne` component: Added a tSNE dimensionality reduction component (PR #742).

# openpipelines 1.0.0-rc2

## BUG FIXES

* Cellranger multi: Fix using a relative input path for `--vdj_inner_enrichment_primers` (PR #717)

* `dataflow/split_modalities`: remove unused `compression` argument. Use `output_compression` instead (PR #714).

* `metadata/grep_annotation_column`: fix calculating fraction when an input observation has no counts, which caused
the result to be out of bounds.

* Fix `--output` argument not working for several workflows (PR #740).

## MINOR CHANGES

* `metadata/grep_annotation_column`: Added more logging output (PR #697).

* `metadata/add_id` and `metadata/grep_annotation_column`: Bump python to 3.11 (PR #697).

* Bump viash to 0.8.5 (PR #697)

* `dataflow/split_modalities`: add more logging output and bump python to 3.12 (PR #714).

* `correction/cellbender`: Update nextflow resource labels from `singlecpu` and `lowmem` to `midcpu` and `midmem` (PR #736)

# openpipelines 1.0.0rc1

## BREAKING CHANGES

* Change separator for arguments with multiple inputs from `:` to `;` (PR #700 and #707). Now, _all_ arguments with `multiple: true` will use `;` as the separator.
  This change was made to be able to deal with file paths that contain `:`, e.g. `s3://my-bucket/my:file.txt`. Furthermore, the `;` separator will become
  the default separator for all arguments with `multiple: true` in Viash >= 0.9.0.

* This project now uses viash version 0.8.4 to build components and workflows. Changes related to this version update should
  be _mostly_ backwards compatible with respect to the results and execution of the pipelines. From a development perspective,
  drastic updates have been made to the developemt workflow.

  Development related changes:
    * Bump viash version to 0.8.4 (PR #598, PR#638 and #706) in the project configuration.
    * All pipelines no longer use the anonymous workflow. Instead, these workflows were given
      a name which was added to the viash config as the entrypoint to the pipeline (PR #598).
    * Removed the `workflows` folder and moved its contents to new locations:
        1. The `resources_test_scripts` folder now resides in the root of the project (PR #605).
        2. All workflows have been moved to the `src/workflows` folder (PR #605).
           This implies that workflows must now be build using `viash (ns) build`, just like with components.
        3. Adjust GitHub Actions to account for new workflow paths (PR #605).
        4. In order to be backwards compatible, the `workflows` folder now contains symbolic
           links to the build workflows in `target`. This is not a problem when using the repository for pipeline
           execution. However, if a developer wishes to contribute to the project, symlink support should be enabled
           in git using `git config core.symlinks=true`. Alternatively, use
           `git clone -c core.symlinks=true git@github.com:openpipelines-bio/openpipeline.git` when cloning the
           repository. This avoids the symlinks being resolved (PR #628). 
        4bis. With PR #668, the workflows have been renamed. This does not hamper the backwards compatibility
              of the symlinks that have been described in 4, because they still use the original location
              which includes the original name.
                * `multiomics/rna_singlesample` has been renamed to `rna/process_single_sample`,
                * `multiomics/rna_multisample` has been renamed to `rna/rna_multisample`,
                * `multiomics/prot_multisample` became `prot/prot_multisample`,
                * `multiomics/prot_singlesample` became `prot/prot_singlesample`,
                * `multiomics/full_pipeline` was moved to `multiomics/process_samples`,
                * `multiomics/multisample` has been renamed to `multiomics/process_batches`,
                * `multiomics/integration/initialize_integration` changed to `multiomics/dimensionality_reduction`,
                * finally, all workflows at `multiomics/integration/*` were moved to `integration/*`

        5. Removed the `workflows/utils` folder. Functionality that was provided by the `DataflowHelper` 
           and `WorkflowHelper` is now being provided by viash when the workflow is being build (PR #605).

  End-user facing changes:
    * The `concat` component had been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
      It's functionality has been copied to the `concatenate_h5mu` component because the name is in
      conflict with the `concat` operator from nextflow (PR #598).
    * `prot_singlesample`, `rna_singlesample`, `prot_multisample` and `rna_multisample`: QC statistics
       are now only calculated once where needed. This means that the mitochondrial gene detection is
       performed in the `rna_singlesample` pipeline and the other count based statistics are calculated
       during the `prot_multisample` and `rna_multisample` pipelines. In both cases, the `qc` pipeline
       is being used, but only parts of that workflow are activated by parametrization. Previously
       the count based statistics were calculated in both the `singlesample` and `multisample` pipelines,
       with the results from the multisample pipelines overwriting the previous results. What is breaking here
       is that the qc statistics are not being added to the results of the singlesample worklows.
       This is _not_ an issue when using the `full_pipeline` because in this case the singlesample and
       multisample workflows are executed in-tandem. If you wish to execute the singlesample workflows
       in a seperate manner and still include count based statistics, please run the `qc` pipeline
       on the result of the singlesample workflow (PR #604).
    * `filter/filter_with_hvg` has been renamed to `feature_annotation/highly_variable_features_scanpy`, along with the following changes (PR #667).
      - `--do_filter` was removed
      - `--n_top_genes` has been renamed to `--n_top_features`
    * `full_pipeline`, `multisample` and `rna_multisample`: Renamed arguments (PR #667).
      - `--filter_with_hvg_var_output` became `--highly_variable_features_obs_batch_key`
      - `--filter_with_hvg_obs_batch_key` became `--highly_variable_features_var_output`
    * `rna_multisample`: Renamed arguments (PR #667).
      - `--filter_with_hvg_n_top_genes` became `--highly_variable_features_n_top_features`
      - `--filter_with_hvg_flavor` became `--highly_variable_features_flavor`
 
* Renamed `obsm_metrics` to `uns_metrics` for the `cellranger_mapping` workflow because the cellranger metrics are stored in `.uns` and not `.obsm` (PR #610).

## MAJOR CHANGES

* `mapping/cellranger_mkfastq`: update from cellranger `6.0.2` to `7.0.1` (PR #675)

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `multisample` pipeline: This workflow now works when provided multimple unimodal files or multiple multimodal files, in addition to the previously supported single multimodal file (PR #606). The modalities are processed independently from each other:
  - As before, a single multimodal file is split into several unimodal MuData objects, each modality being stored in a file.
  - (New) When multiple unimodal files are provided, they can be used used as is.
  - (New) Mosaic input (i.e. multiple uni- or multimodal files) are split into unimodal files.
    Providing the same modality twice is not supported however, meaning the modalities should be unique.
    For example, using `input: ["data1.h5mu", "data2.h5mu"]` with `data1.h5mu` providing data for `rna` and `atac` 
    and `data2.h5mu` for `rna` and `prot` will not work, because the `rna` modality is present in both input files.
  
* `multisample` workflow: throw an error when argument values for the merge component or the `initialize_integration` workflow differ between the inputs (PR #606).

* Added a `split_modalities` workflow in order to split a multimodal mudata files into several unimodal mudata files. Its behavior is identical to the `split_modalities` component, but it also provides functionality to make sure everything works when nextflow's `-stub` option is enabled (PR #606).

* All workflow now use `dependencies` to handle includes from other workflows (PR #606).

* `qc/calculate_qc_metrics`: allow setting the output column names and disabling the calculation of several metrics (PR #644).

* `rna_multisample`, `prot_multisample` and `qc` workflows: allow setting the output column names and disabling the calculation of several metrics (PR #606).

* `cluster/leiden`: Allow calculating multiple resolutions in parallel (PR #645).

* `qc/calculate_qc_metrics`: allow setting the output column names and disabling the calculation of several metrics (PR #644).

* `rna_multisample` workflow: added `--modality` argument (PR #607).

* `multisample` workflow: in addition to using multimodal files as input, this workflow now also accepts a list of files. The list of files must be the unimodal equivalents of a split multimodal file. The modalities in the list must be unique and after processing the modalities will be merged into multimodal files (PR #606).

* Added `filter/intersect_obs` component which removes observations that are not shared between modalities (PR #589).

* Re-enable `convert/from_h5mu_to_seurat` component (PR #616).

* Added the `gdo_singlesample` pipeline with basic count filtering (PR #672).

* `process_samples` pipeline: the `--rna_layer`, `--prot_layer` and `gdo_layer` argument can not be used to specify an alternative layer to .X where the raw data are stored. To enable this feature, the following changes were required:
  - Added `transform/move_layer` component.
  - `filter/filter_with_scrublet`: added `--layer` argument.
  - `transform/clr`: added `--input_layer` argument.
  - `metadata/grep_annotation_column`: added `--input_layer` argument.
  - `rna/rna_singlesample`, `rna/rna_multisample`, `prot/prot_singlesample` and `prot/prot_multisample`: add `--layer` argument.
  - `process_batches`: Added `rna_layer` and `prot_layer` arguments.

* Enable dataset functionality for nf-tower (PR #701)

* Added `annotate/score_genes` and `annotate/score_genes_cell_cycle` to calculate scanpy gene scores (PR #703).

## MINOR CHANGES

* Refactored `rna_multisample` (PR #607), `cellranger_multi` (PR #609), `cellranger_mapping` (PR #610) and other (PR #606) pipelines to use `fromState` and `toState` functionality.

* `metadata/add_id`: add more runtime logging (PR #663).

* `cluster/leiden`: Bump python to 3.11 and leidenalg to 0.10.0 (PR #645).

* `mapping/htseq_count_to_h5mu` and `multi_star`: update polars and gtfparse (PR #642). 

* Pin `from_h5mu_to_seurat` to use Seurat to version 4 (PR #630).

* `velocity/scvelo`: bump scvelo to 0.3.1 and python to 3.10 (PR #640).

* Updated the Viash YAML schemas to the latest version of Viash (PR #620).

* `build_cellranger_reference` and `build_bdrhap_reference`: Bump go version to `1.21.4` when building seqkit for testing the component (PR #624 and PR #637).

* `correction/cellbender_remove_background`: Remove `muon` as a test dependency (PR #636).

* (Automatic testing) Update viashpy to 0.6.0 (PR #665).

* `integrate/scarches`, `integrate/scvi`, `velocity/scvelo` and `integrate/totalvi`: pin jax, jaxlib to `<0.4.23` (PR #699).

* `integrate/scvi`: Unpin `numba` and pin scvi-tools to `1.0.3` (PR #699).

* `integrate/totalvi`: Enable GPU-accelerated computing, unpin `torchmetrics` and pin jax, jaxlib to `<0.4.23` (PR #699).

## BUG FIXES

* `transform/log1p`: fix `--input_layer` argument not functioning (PR #678). 

* `dataflow/concat` and `dataflow/concatenate_h5mu`: Fix an issue where using `--mode move` on samples with non-overlapping features would cause `var_names` to become unaligned to the data (PR #653).   

* `filter/filter_with_scrublet`: (Testing) Fix duplicate test function names (PR #641).

* `dataflow/concatenate_h5mu` and `dataflow/concat`: Fix `TypeError` when using mode 'move' and a column with conflicting metadata does not exist across all samples (PR #631).

* `dataflow/concatenate_h5mu` and `dataflow/concat`: Fix an issue where joining columns with different datatypes caused `TypeError` (PR #619).

* `qc/calculate_qc_metrics`: Resolved an issue where statistics based on the input columns selected with `--var_qc_metrics` were incorrect when these input columns were encoded in `pd.BooleanDtype()` (PR #685).

* `move_obsm_to_obs`: fix setting output columns when they already exist (PR #690).

* `workflows/dimensionality_reduction` workflow: nearest neighbour calculations no longer recalcalates the PCA when `obm_input` `--obsm_pca` is not set to `X_pca`.

* `feature_annotation/highly_variable_scanpy`: fix .X being used to remove observations with 0 counts when `--layer` has been specified. 

* `filter/filter_with_counts`: fix `--layer` argument not being used.

* `transform/normalize_total`: fix incorrect layer being written to the output when the input layer if not `.X`.

* `src/workflows/qc`: fix input layer not being taken into account when calculating the fraction of mitochondrial genes (always used .X).

* `convert/from_cellranger_multi_to_h5mu`: fix metric values not repesented as percentages being devided by 100. (#704).

# openpipelines 0.12.1

## BUG FIXES

* `rna_singlesample`: Fix filtering parameters values `min_counts`, `max_counts`, `min_genes_per_cell`, `max_genes_per_cell` and `min_cells_per_gene` not being passed to the `filter_with_counts` component (PR #614).

* `prot_singlesample`: Fix filtering parameters values `min_counts`, `max_counts`, `min_proteins_per_cell`, `max_proteins_per_cell` and `min_cells_per_protein` not being passed to the `filter_with_counts` component (PR #614).

# openpipelines 0.12.0

## BREAKING CHANGES

The detection of mitochondrial genes has been revisited in order to remove the interdependency with the count filtering and the QC metric calculation.
Implementing this changes involved breaking some existing functionality:

* `filter/filter_with_counts`: removed `--var_gene_names`, `--mitochondrial_gene_regex`, `--var_name_mitochondrial_genes`, `--min_fraction_mito` and `--max_fraction_mito` (PR #585).

* `workflows/prot_singlesample`: removed `--min_fraction_mito` and `--max_fraction_mito` because regex-based detection detection of mitochondrial genes is not possible (PR #585).

* The fraction of counts that originated from mitochondrial genes used to be written to an .obs column with a name that was derived from `pct_` suffixed by the name of the mitochondrial gene column. The `--obs_name_mitochondrial_fraction` argument is introduced to change the destination column and the default prefix has changed from `pct_` to `fraction_` (PR #585).

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `workflows/qc`: A pipeline to add basic qc statistics to a MuData object (PR #585). 

* `workflows/rna_singlesample`: added `--obs_name_mitochondrial_fraction` and make sure that the values from `--max_fraction_mito`  and `--min_fraction_mito` are bound between 0 and 1 (PR #585).

* Added `filter/delimit_fraction`: Turns an annotation column containing values between 0 and 1 into a boolean column based on thresholds (PR #585).

* Added `metadata/grep_annotation_column`: Perform a regex lookup on a column from the annotation matrices .obs or .var (PR #585).

* `workflows/full_pipelines`: added `--obs_name_mitochondrial_fraction` argument (PR #585).

* `workflows/prot_multisample`: added `--var_qc_metrics` and `--top_n_vars` arguments (PR #585).

* Added genetic demultiplexing methods `cellsnp`, `demuxlet`, `freebayes`, `freemuxlet`, `scsplit`, `sourorcell` and `vireo` (PR #343).

## MINOR CHANGES

* Several components: bump scanpy to 1.9.5 (PR #594).

* Refactored `prot_multisample` and `prot_singlesample` pipelines to use `fromState` and `toState` functionality (PR #585).

# openpipelines 0.11.0

## BREAKING CHANGES

* Nextflow VDSL3: set `simplifyOutput` to `False` by default. This implies that components and workflows will output a hashmap with a sole "output" entry when there is only one output (PR #563).

* `integrate/scvi`: rename `model_output` argument to `output_model` in order to align with the `scvi_leiden` workflow. This also fixes a bug with the workflow where the argument did not function (PR  #562).

## MINOR CHANGES

* `dataflow/concat`: reduce memory consumption when using `--other_axis_mode move` by processing only one annotation matrix (`.var`, `.obs`) at a time (PR #569).

* Update viashpy and pin it to `0.5.0` (PR #572 and PR #577).

* `convert/from_h5ad_to_h5mu`, `convert/from_h5mu_to_h5ad`, `dimred/pca`, `dimred/umap/`, 
`filter/filter_with_counts`, `filter/filter_with_hvg`, `filter/remove_modality`, `filter/subset_h5mu`, 
`integrate/scanorama`, `transform/delete_layer` and `transform/log1p`: update python to `3.9` (PR #572).

* `integrate/scarches`: update base image, `scvi-tools` and `pandas` to `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:23.09-py3`, `~=1.0.3` and `~=2.1.0` respectively (PR #572).

* `integrate/totalvi`: update python to 3.9 and scvi-tools to `~=1.0.3` (PR #572).

* `correction/cellbender_remove_background`: change base image to `nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04` and downwgrade MuData to 0.2.1 because it is the oldest version that uses python 3.7 (PR #575).

* Several integration workflows: prevent leiden from being executed when no resolutions are provided (PR #583).

* `dataflow/concat`: bump pandas to ~=2.1.1 and reduce memory consumption by only reading one modality into memory at a time (PR #568). 

* `annotate/popv`: bump `jax` and `jaxlib` to `0.4.10`, scanpy to `1.9.4`, scvi to `1.0.3` and pin `ml-dtypes` to < 0.3.0 (PR #565).

* `velocity/scvelo`: pin matplotlib to < 3.8.0 (PR #566).

* `mapping/multi_star`: pin multiqc to 1.15.0 (PR #566).

* `mapping/bd_rhapsody`: pin pandas version to <2 (PR #563). 

* `query/cellxgene_census`: replaced label `singlecpu` with label `midcpu`.

* `query/cellxgene_census`: avoid creating MuData object in memory by writing the modality directly to disk (PR #558).

* `integrate/scvi`: use `midcpu` label instead of `singlecpu` (PR #561).

## BUG FIXES

* `transform/clr`: raise an error when CLR fails to return the requested output (PR #579).

* `correction/cellbender_remove_background`: fix missing helper functionality when using Fusion (PR #575).

* `convert/from_bdrhap_to_h5mu`: Avoid `TypeError: Can't implicitly convert non-string objects to strings` by using categorical dtypes when a string column contains NA values (PR #563).

* `qc/calculate_qc_metrics`: fix calculating mitochondrial gene related QC metrics when only or no mitochondrial genes were found (PR #564).

# openpipelines 0.10.1

## MINOR CHANGES

* `integration/scvi_leiden`: Expose hvg selection argument `--var_input` (#543, PR #547).

## BUG FIXES

* `integration/bbknn_leiden`: Set leiden clustering parameter to multiple (#542, PR #545).

* `integration/scvi_leiden`: Fix component name in Viash config (PR #547).

* `integration/harmony_leiden`: Pass `--uns_neighbors` argument `umap` (PR #548).

* Add workaround for bug where resources aren't available when using Nextflow fusion by including `setup_logger`, `subset_vars` and `compress_h5mu` in the script itself (PR #549).

# openpipelines 0.10.0


## BREAKING CHANGES

* `workflows/full_pipeline`: removed `--prot_min_fraction_mito` and `--prot_max_fraction_mito` (PR #451)

* `workflows/rna_multisample` and `workflows/prot_multisample`: Removed concatenation from these pipelines. The input for these pipelines is now a single mudata file that contains data for multiple samples. If you wish to use this pipeline on multiple single-sample mudata files, you can use the `dataflow/concat` components on them first. This also implies that the ability to add ids to multiple single-sample mudata files prior to concatenation is no longer required, hence the removal of `--add_id_to_obs`, `--sample_id`, `--add_id_obs_output`,  and `--add_id_make_observation_keys_unique` (PR #475).

* The `scvi` pipeline was renamed to `scvi_leiden` because `leiden` clustering was added to the pipeline (PR #499).

* Upgrade `correction/cellbender_remove_background` from CellBender v0.2 to CellBender v0.3.0 (PR #523).
  Between these versions, several arguments related to the slots of the output file have been changed.

## MAJOR CHANGES

* Several components: update anndata to 0.9.3 and mudata to 0.2.3 (PR #423).

* Base resources assigned for a process without any labels is now 1 CPU and 2GB (PR #518).

* Updated to Viash 0.7.5 (PR #513).

* Removed deprecated `variant: vdsl3` tags (PR #513).

* Removed unused `version: dev` (PR #513).

* `multiomics/integration/harmony_leiden`: Refactored data flow (PR #513).

* `ingestion/bd_rhapsody`: Refactored data flow (PR #513).

* `query/cellxgene_census`: increased returned metadata content, revised query option, added filtering strategy and refactored functionality (PR #520).

* Refactor loggers using `setup_logger()` helper function (PR #534).

* Refactor unittest tests to pytest tests (PR #534).

## MINOR CHANGES

* Add resource labels to several components (PR #518).

* `full_pipeline`: default value for `--var_qc_metrics` is now the combined values specified for `--mitochondrial_gene_regex` and `--filter_with_hvg_var_output`.

* `dataflow/concat`: reduce memory consumption by only reading one modality at the same time (PR #474).

* Components that use CellRanger, BCL Convert or bcl2fastq: updated from Ubuntu 20.04 to Ubuntu 22.04 (PR #494).

* Components that use CellRanger: updated Picard to 2.27.5 (PR #494).

* `interprete/liana`: Update lianapy to 0.1.9 (PR #497).

* `qc/multiqc`: add unittests (PR #502).

* `reference/build_cellranger_reference`: add unit tests (PR #506).

* `reference/build_bd_rhapsody_reference`: add unittests (PR #504).

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* Added `compression/compress_h5mu` component (PR #530).

* Resource management: when a process exits with a status code between 137 and 140, retry the process with increased memory requirements. Memory scales by multiplying the base memory assigned to the process with the attempt number (PR #518 and PR #527).

* `integrate/scvi`: Add `--n_hidden_nodes`, `--n_dimensions_latent_space`, `--n_hidden_layers`, `--dropout_rate`, `--dispersion`, `--gene_likelihood`, `--use_layer_normalization`, `--use_batch_normalization`, `--encode_covariates`, `--deeply_inject_covariates` and `--use_observed_lib_size` parameters.

* `filter/filter_with_counts`: add `--var_name_mitochondrial_genes` argument to store a boolean array corresponding the detected mitochondrial genes.

The idea is to allow a a re-run of these steps after a sample has already been processed by the `full_pipeline`. Keep in mind that samples that are provided as input to this pipeline are processed separately and are not concatenated. Hence, the input should be a concatenated sample (PR #475).

# openpipelines 0.9.0

## BREAKING CHANGES

Running the integration in the `full_pipeline` deemed to be impractical because a plethora of integration methods exist, which in turn interact with other functionality (like clustering). This generates a large number of possible usecases which one pipeline cannot cover in an easy manner. Instead, each integration methods will be split into its separate pipeline, and the `full_pipeline` will prepare for integration by performing steps that are required by many integration methods. Therefore, the following changes were performed:

  * `workflows/full_pipeline`: `harmony` integration and `leiden` clustering are removed from the pipeline.

  * Added `initialize_integration` to run calculations that output information commonly required by the integration methods. This pipeline runs PCA, nearest neighbours and UMAP. This pipeline is run as a subpipeline at the end of `full_pipeline`.

  * Added `leiden_harmony` integration pipeline: run harmony integration followed by neighbour calculations and leiden clustering. Also runs umap on the result.

  * Removed the `integration` pipeline.

The old behavior of the `full_pipeline` can be obtained by running `full_pipeline` followed by the `leiden_harmony` pipeline.

* The `crispr` and `hashing` modalities have been renamed to `gdo` and `hto` respectively (PR #392).

* Updated Viash to 0.7.4 (PR #390).

* `cluster/leiden`: Output is now stored into `.obsm` instead of `.obs` (PR #431).

## NEW FUNCTIONALITY

* `cluster/leiden` and `integration/harmony_leiden`: allow running leiden multiple times with multiple resolutions (PR #431).

* `mapping/cellranger_multi` and `workflows/ingestion/cellranger_multi`: Added `--vdj_inner_enrichment_primers` argument (PR #417).

* `metadata/move_obsm_to_obs`: Move a matrix from an `.obsm` slot into `.obs` (PR #431).

* `integrate/scvi` validity checks for non-normalized input, obs and vars in order to proceed to training (PR #429).

## MINOR CHANGES

* `integrate/scvi`: update scvi to 1.0.0 (PR #448)

* `mapping/multi_star`: Added `--min_success_rate` which causes component to fail when the success rate of processed samples were successful (PR #408).

## MAJOR CHANGES

* Removed `bin` folder. As of viash 0.6.4, a `_viash.yaml` file can be included in the root of a repository to set common viash options for the project.
These options were previously covered in the `bin/init` script, but this new feature of viash makes its use unnecessary. The `viash` and `nextlow` should now be installed in a directory that is included in your `$PATH`.

* Several components: pin matplotlib to <3.7 to fix scanpy compatibility (see https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2411).  

* `workflows`: fix a bug when running a subworkflow from a workflow would cause the parent config to be read instead of the subworklow config.

* `correction/cellbender_remove_background`: Fix description of input for cellbender_remove_background.

* `mapping/htseq_count_to_h5mu`: Convert one or more HTSeq outputs to a MuData file.

* Added from `convert/from_cellranger_multi_to_h5mu` component.

## MAJOR CHANGES

# openpipeline 0.5.1

## BREAKING CHANGES

* `reference/make_reference`: Input files changed from `type: string` to `type: file` to allow Nextflow to cache the input files fetched from URL.

* several components (except `from_h5ad_to_h5mu`): the `--modality` arguments no longer accept multiple values.

* Remove outdated `resources_test_scripts`.

* `convert/from_h5mu_to_seurat`: Disabled because MuDataSeurat is currently broken, see [https://github.com/PMBio/MuDataSeurat/issues/9](PMBio/MuDataSeurat#9).

* `integrate/harmony`: Disabled because it is currently not functioning and the alternative, harmonypy, is used in the workflows.

* `dataflow/concat`: Renamed --sample_names to --input_id and moved the ability to add sample id and to join the sample ids with the observation names to `metadata/add_id`

* Moved `dataflow/concat`, `dataflow/merge` and `dataflow/split_modalities` to a new namespace: `dataflow`.

* Moved `workflows/conversion/conversion` to `workflows/ingestion/conversion`

      | pmap{ id, data ->
        [id, data + [arg: 10]]
      }
  }
  ```
  Note that in the example above, using a regular `map` would result in an exception being thrown,
  that is, "Invalid method invocation `call` with arguments".

  A synonymous of doing this with a regular `map()` would be:
  ```groovy
  workflow {
    Channel.fromList([["id", [input: "foo"], "passthrough"]])
      | map{ tup ->
        def (id, data) = tup
        [id, data + [arg: 10]] + tup.drop(2)
      }
  }

## MAJOR CHANGES

* `workflows/utils/DataflowHelper.nf`: Added helper functions `setWorkflowArguments()` and `getWorkflowArguments()` to split the data field of a channel event into a hashmap. Example usage:
  ```groovy
  | setWorkflowArguments(
    pca: [ "input": "input", "obsm_output": "obsm_pca" ]
    integration: [ "obs_covariates": "obs_covariates", "obsm_input": "obsm_pca" ]
  )

* Switch to Viash 0.6.1.

* `filter/subset_h5mu`: Add `--modality` argument, export to VDSL3, add unit test.

* `dataflow/split_modalities`: Also output modality types in a separate csv.

## BUG FIXES

* `dataflow/concat`: Added `"move"` option to `--other_axis_mode`, which allows merging `.obs` and `.var` by only keeping elements of the matrices which are the same in each of the samples, moving the conflicting values to `.varm` or `.obsm`.

## MAJOR CHANGES

* Multiple components: Update to anndata 0.8 with mudata 0.2.0. This means that the format of the `.h5mu` files have changed.

* `multiomics/rna_singlesample`: Move transformation counts into layers instead of overwriting `.X`.

* Updated to Viash 0.6.0.

## MINOR CHANGES

* `velocity/velocyto`: Allow configuring memory and parallellisation.

* `cluster/leiden`: Add `--obsp_connectivities` parameter to allow choosing the output slot.

* `workflows/multiomics/rna_singlesample`, `workflows/multiomics/rna_multisample` and `workflows/multiomics/integration`: Allow choosing the output paths.

* `neighbors/bbknn` and `neighbors/find_neighbors`: Add parameters for choosing the input/output slots.

* `dimred/pca` and `dimred/umap`: Add parameters for choosing the input/output slots.

* `dataflow/concat`: Optimize concat performance by adding multiprocessing and refactoring functions.

* `workflows/multimodal_integration`: Add `obs_covariates` argument to pipeline.

## BUG FIXES

* Several components: Revert using slim versions of containers because they do not provide the tools to run nextflow with trace capabilities.

* `dataflow/concat`: Fix an issue where joining boolean values caused `TypeError`.

* `workflows/multiomics/rna_multisample`, `workflows/multiomics/rna_singlesample` and `workflows/multiomics/integration`: Use nextflow trace reporting when running integration tests.
